# HW5 ‚Äì Ethical AI: Privacy in Text Classification

## üìå Overview
This project explores privacy concerns in text classification tasks using logistic regression. The goal is to demonstrate how a model can leak private user information, and then apply different anonymization techniques to correct the issue without significantly sacrificing accuracy.

---

## üß† Project Objectives

1. **Detect Privacy Leak:**  
   Show how a model can memorize and exploit usernames in the training data, leading to privacy violations.

2. **Fix the Leak:**  
   Implement a basic anonymization method by replacing usernames with a generic placeholder.

3. **Explore Better Anonymization:**  
   Compare aggressive anonymization (removing capitalized words) with a smarter method that maintains context and preserves model performance.

## üß™ Methods Used

- **Logistic Regression** (via `sklearn`)
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** (no preprocessing)
- Manual probing with `.predict()` and `.predict_proba()`
- Custom anonymization techniques using regex and string manipulation
